Sustentation? Warehouseify! 
A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable goods, which indicates that predicting the daily and weekly drmands plays an important role in sales. Too much of inventory can lead to wastage whereas not enough can lead to 
loss of company. Since tha raw materials are perishable, planing the demand for weekly basis is of utmost importance. Hence we propose the solution of developing a web application to interact with the machine learning models to predict the demand based on fluctuating customer needs and supply situations.
